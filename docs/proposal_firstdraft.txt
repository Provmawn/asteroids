We plan to create a 2D shooting game, similar to Asteroids, using C++ and an open source library to handle sprites and inputs. 
The goal of the project is to have full control of movement and shooting projectiles in all 8 cardinal directions, and to have an endless loop of enemies or obstacles supplied.
We aim to use SDL as the backbone of our game, an open source libraries for C/C++ that allow drawing of sprites to surfaces and the reading of keyboard and joypad input. The library can be found here: http://www.libsdl.org/
